# Hop_ON
A user-friendly public bus information website built with an HCI-first approach. The site highlights nearby bus stops as the main feature, helping users easily see which buses stop there and where they go. Designed with large text, clear icons, maps, and a calm palette to be accessible for elderly and non-tech-savvy users.
